## [2.0.0] - 2025-08-19

### üéâ Major Release: Transfer Cancellation System

This release introduces comprehensive transfer cancellation functionality, resolving the critical issue where transfers would get stuck at specific percentages indefinitely.

### ‚ú® Added

#### üõë Transfer Cancellation System
- **Cancel Transfer API Endpoint** (`/api/cancel-transfer`)
  - Immediately stops ongoing transfers
  - Clears progress tracking data
  - Marks transfer as cancelled in connection state
  - Returns proper success/error responses

- **Frontend Cancel Button Integration**
  - Enhanced `cancelTransfer()` method with API integration
  - Proper cleanup of progress monitoring intervals
  - User-friendly cancellation confirmation messages
  - Immediate UI feedback on cancellation

#### üîç Stuck Transfer Detection
- **Automatic Detection Algorithm**
  - Monitors progress every 5 seconds (200ms intervals)
  - Detects transfers with no progress for 2+ minutes
  - Automatically offers cancellation option
  - Resets detection counters when progress resumes

- **Smart Progress Monitoring**
  - Enhanced timeout handling for slow connections
  - Better error handling for network issues
  - Improved responsiveness with faster polling

#### üõ°Ô∏è Enhanced Error Handling
- **Cancellation vs Error Distinction**
  - Separate handling for user cancellation vs system errors
  - Proper error messages and user feedback
  - Graceful cleanup on both cancellation and errors

- **Backend Cancellation Checks**
  - Progress callbacks check for cancellation flags
  - Transfer loops include cancellation validation
  - Immediate termination when cancellation detected

### üêõ Fixed

#### üö® Critical Issues Resolved
- **Transfer Stuck at Specific Percentages**
  - **Problem:** Transfers would freeze at percentages like 10.3% indefinitely
  - **Root Cause:** No cancellation mechanism and continued progress polling
  - **Solution:** Comprehensive cancellation system with proper cleanup

- **Infinite Progress Polling Loop**
  - **Problem:** JavaScript continued making progress requests after transfer failure
  - **Root Cause:** Missing cleanup in progress monitoring
  - **Solution:** Proper cleanup in `stopProgressMonitoring()` with state reset

- **Backend Process Cleanup**
  - **Problem:** SCP transfer processes weren't terminated on cancellation
  - **Root Cause:** No cancellation checks in transfer operations
  - **Solution:** Added cancellation validation in progress callbacks and loops

#### üîß Technical Fixes
- **Progress Callback Enhancement**
  ```python
  # Added cancellation checks in progress callbacks
  if session_id in self.connections and \
     self.connections[session_id].get('transfer_cancelled', False):
      raise Exception("Transfer cancelled by user")
  ```

- **Frontend State Management**
  ```javascript
  // Proper cleanup of monitoring variables
  this.lastProgressUpdate = 0;
  this.lastProgressValue = 0;
  this.stuckCheckCount = 0;
  ```

- **Transfer Loop Validation**
  ```python
  # Check for cancellation before processing each file
  if session_id in self.connections and \
     self.connections[session_id].get('transfer_cancelled', False):
      logger.info(f"Transfer cancelled by user for session {session_id}")
      break
  ```

### üîÑ Changed

#### ‚ö° Performance Improvements
- **Progress Monitoring Frequency**
  - Increased from 1-second to 200ms intervals
  - More responsive progress updates
  - Better handling of slow internet connections

- **Timeout Handling**
  - Added 2-second timeout for progress requests
  - Graceful handling of network timeouts
  - Improved error recovery mechanisms

#### üé® UI/UX Enhancements
- **Progress Modal Improvements**
  - Cancel button always visible during transfers
  - Better visual feedback on cancellation
  - Enhanced error and success messages

- **User Feedback System**
  - Clear distinction between cancellation and errors
  - Professional completion modals
  - Improved progress information display

### üß™ Testing

#### ‚úÖ New Test Coverage
- **Cancel Transfer Test Script** (`test_cancel_transfer.py`)
  - Validates cancel endpoint availability
  - Tests progress monitoring functionality
  - Provides manual testing guidelines

- **Manual Testing Scenarios**
  - Large file transfer cancellation
  - Stuck transfer detection
  - Network timeout handling
  - Multiple file transfer cancellation
